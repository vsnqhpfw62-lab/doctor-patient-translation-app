## Healthcare Doctor–Patient Translation Web App

This is a prototype web application built for Nao Medical’s take-home assignment.

### What it does
- Allows a doctor and patient to communicate via a role-based chat interface
- Translates text messages between selected languages
- Supports browser-based audio recording and playback
- Logs conversation messages with timestamps
- Generates a basic AI-powered conversation summary

### Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Node.js + Express (Backend prototype)

### Notes
This project was built as a time-boxed prototype to demonstrate system design, feature prioritization, and AI integration. The deployed version focuses on frontend interaction and user experience, while the repository includes backend code to illustrate the intended server-side architecture and data flow. With additional time, the backend would be connected to persistent storage and real-time communication services.
