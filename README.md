## Healthcare Doctor–Patient Translation Web App

This is a prototype web application built for Nao Medical’s take-home assignment.

### What it does
- Allows a doctor and patient to communicate via a role-based chat interface
- Translates text messages between selected languages
- Supports browser-based audio recording and playback
- Logs conversation messages with timestamps
- Generates a basic AI-powered conversation summary

### Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Node.js + Express (Backend prototype)

### Notes
Due to time constraints and an iPad-only development environment, the deployed version focuses on frontend functionality. Backend logic is included in the repository to demonstrate full-stack architecture and intended server-side design.
